# Backup Virtualmin Virtual Server
Anyone using Virtualmin to host websites? doing a backup of the entire virtual server sometimes takes a bit of time.
Use this Python script to automate the backup procedure for you.

Tested using Python v3.7 and on Virtualmin v6.08 works well.

Note: *pip3 install selenium* before you run this script.
